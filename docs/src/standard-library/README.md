# The standard library

When compiling a program, a basic set of transformations is available to the user.
These transformations are used to manipulate data in various ways.
There exist two main categories of such operations:

1. **Expressions** are performed over Lists of primitive types (_e.g._ `List[Int]`, `List[String]`, `List[Boolean]`).
2. **Transformations** are performed over Lists of Record types (_e.g._ `List[Person]`, `List[Product]`, `List[Order]`).
